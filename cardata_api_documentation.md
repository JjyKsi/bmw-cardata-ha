1. Introduction
BMW Group vehicles generate telematics data that are transferred exclusively to secure BMW servers. These data points are stored and can be accessed in accordance with the Extended Vehicle (ExVe) approach. For instance, this data may include status information such as mileage, usage-based metrics like average fuel consumption, or event data such notifications about automatic service calls.

In addition to the Customer Archive which provides your vehicle data conveniently packaged in a .zip file, BMW CarData enables access to your vehicle data on a technical level: via data streams and RESTful APIs. We aim to guide you to establish an initial connection and then retrieve your vehicle on a continuous basis via these commonly used technologies.
For individuals with a solid understanding of modern IT-concepts and -technologies, this document provides the necessary technical details and metadata to help you retrieve a personalized set of data generated by your vehicle. While this document reflects the recommended sequence of actions to take, the data stream and RESTful API function as independent and parallel solutions, with no direct dependency on each other.

The following illustration offers an overview of the obligatory steps to establish your technical connection to BMW CarData.

CarData
Figure 1: Overview


1.1 Frequently used terms
Connected Drive portal

BMW ConnectedDrive includes all innovative equipment and features designed to intelligently connect vehicle occupants and the vehicle to the outside world. This includes telematics services, vehicle assistance systems, integration with mobile and devices, entertainment options and traffic services.


Customer portals

BMW customers can use the "My BMW ConnectedDrive" customer portal to manage personal data and vehicle settings necessary for utilizing BMW ConnectedDrive services within the vehicle, across various applications and via the BMW ConnectedDrive call center. Additionally, customers can add services or extend the active duration of existing ones. The customer information entrusted to BMW CarData is integrated to the My BMW portal, enabling customers to view and manage data access clearances (permissions) for third parties.

VIN

The Vehicle Identification Number (VIN) is a standardized 17-digit code used to uniquely identify a vehicle.


Mapping

The link between a Customer ID (“GCID”) and a VIN is referred to as “mapping”. Once a vehicle is mapped to your account, you are identified as the owner or user, allowing you to access vehicle-related functions and services through My BMW app or web portal, such as Remote Services to lock or unlock your vehicle.
For further instructions on how to map visit these links: German or English.


Mapping-type

It is possible to map multiple user accounts to a single VIN. The concepts of PRIMARY (or MAIN user) and SECONDARY (or CO/JOINT user) mappings are explained here: German or English.

Telematic data key

A telematic data key can be seen as one attribute (e.g. mileage) or a logically connected set of attributes (e.g. “basic vehicle data”) containing data generated by your vehicle.


Container

The telematics data (“keys”) are provided in a data structure called “container” representing a specific use case. The containers can be configured individually via API.


Telematics data catalogue (TDC)

The telematics data catalogue is the single-point-of-truth when it comes to the availability of telematics data keys through BMW CarData. You can find the TDC with the link below. Be aware that the TDC is also available in your market language. Find the translated TDC in your customer portal in the CarData section.

1.2 Availability and additional information
In order to retrieve vehicle-data via BMW CarData on a technical level, four prerequisites must be met.

Prerequisites:

your vehicle is equipped with an active SIM card
your vehicle is assigned to a supported market (EU)
you have an active Connected Drive contract
your vehicle is mapped to your Connected Drive account
The terms and conditions for the usage of BMW CarData can be found here (link to: B2C T&Cs).


Timestamps

When retrieving telematics data via the BMW CarData API, timestamps are provided for the respective values. You can use the timestamps to identify when a specific value was transmitted from the vehicle to the backend.

Example response:

{
"name: "vehicle.cabin.infotainment.navigation.currentLocation.longitude",
"timestamp": ""2025-07-28T05:16:53.000Z",
"unit": “degrees”,
"value": "9.498705"
}

All timestamps provided by BMW CarData are specified in the ISO 8601 format.



2. Technical registration
In order to retrieve your vehicle data via a data stream or REST API you must first complete the technical registration. BMW CarData offers a standardized Oauth authorization method: OAuth 2.0 Device Authorization Grant, stated in this document as the Device Code Flow.


2.1 Step 1: Generate your client ID
Generate a CarData client ID in the customer portal frontend. This creates a unique client ID within the BMW back end systems, which will be displayed upon clicking the Create CarData Client button. Your client ID serves two important purposes: it is required for registering your devices using the Device Code Flow (explained in the following chapter), and it is essential for generating tokens to ensure continuous access to your most recent vehicle data.

CarData
Figure 2: Create CarData Client


2.2 Step 2: Subscribe to services
After generating your client ID, it is necessary to subscribe to the relevant services. This allocates a specific scope to your client ID, which is required for the subsequent steps. Upon interacting with the corresponding buttons in the frontend, the following scopes will be allocated to your client ID:


Scopes in CarData:

Description	Scope
Scope for CarData API	cardata:api:read
Scope for CarData Stream	cardata:streaming:read


CarData
Figure 3: Create CarData Client


Consider:

If you have not completed the subscription step before registering your device (see chapter below), your tokens will not work for the corresponding CarData service.


2.3 Step 3: Register via the Device Code Flow
Use a REST client application or the command line to execute the cURLs of the Device Code Flow (DCF). Each of the upcoming example requests will be filled with the host from our Swagger. Sensitive fields have been populated using placeholders in the examples below, while others have been kept as is or truncated to demonstrate their format.
For further details on the available endpoints, please refer to the Swagger file.


2.3.1 Request your codes
To initiate the authorization-process for a specific device, call the endpoint shown below. This method will deliver the user code and the device code provided by our services.

POST /gcdm/oauth/device/code

Request details:

client_id: use the generated client ID from the customer portal
response_type: use the fixed value as stated in the Swagger file
code_challenge: see further explanation below
code_challenge_method: use the fixed value as stated in the Swagger file
scope: use the values as stated in the Swagger File and see further explanation below

Code_verifier & code_challenge:

The S256 code challenge method in PKCE (Proof Key for Code Exchange) improves security by hashing the code verifier using SHA-256 and then encoding the result with Base64url. This approach provides a more secure way to verify the client during the authorization code exchange compared to the plain method, where the code verifier is used directly. The standard is further described here.

code_verifier:

A cryptographically random string generated by the client.

code_challenge:

A transformation of the code_verifier, using either the plain or S256 method.


Scopes:

When authenticating a user with OAuth 2.0, there are generally two ways to request scopes: explicit or default. Requesting specific scopes enhances security and user control by limiting the access granted to the application, while expecting default scopes may result in unnecessary permissions. We recommend explicitly requesting the “authenticate_user” and “openid” scopes, which facilitates the authentication process for OAuth 2.0 (and OpenID Connect). Additionally add the scopes of the services you are interested in and the client ID is subscribed to. See this chapter for the correct notations of the CarData specific scopes. Therefor it is suggested to define the scopes as following:

Example request for a subscription to both services:

curl --request POST \
  --url https://customer.bmwgroup.com/gcdm/oauth/device/code \
  --header 'Accept: application/json' \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded' \
  --data client_id=cj5b3499-4918-40x6-a232-f4112f837d72 \
  --data response_type=device_code \      
  --data 'scope=authenticate_user openid cardata:streaming:read cardata:api:read'
  --data code_challenge=yourCodeChallenge \
  --data code_challenge_method=S256 \

Response details:

user_code: the device verification code
device_code: used by the device to poll for the tokens in the final step of the flow
interval: The minimum amount of time in seconds that the client should wait between polling requests to the token endpoint
expires_in: The lifetime in seconds of the "device_code" and "user_code"
verification_uri: link to the page for the user to authorize the login
verification_uri_complete: link to the page for the user to authorize the login including the user_code


2.3.2 Authenticate the device
After successfully retrieving your user_code & device_code, you now need to authenticate within the given expires_in time. Open the verification_uri_complete link in a browser and log in with your customer portal credentials if you are not already logged in.
Alternatively you can use the highlighted button in the CarData page, which refers to verification_uri-link, to manually add the user_code:

CarData
Figure 4: Authenticate device

After clicking the corresponding frontend button, you will get navigated to a page where the user_code needs to be added:

CarData
Figure 5: Enter Code


2.3.3 Request your tokens
After successfully completing the authentication of your device, you are now able to request your tokens.

/gcdm/oauth/token

Input-parameters:

Content-Type: Use the fixed value as stated in the Swagger
client_id: Use the generated client ID from the customer portal
device_code: Part of the response of POST /gcdm/oauth/device/code
grant_type: Use the fixed value as stated in the Swagger, additional information here
code_verifier: See explanation from this chapter
Example request

curl --request POST \
  --url https://customer.bmwgroup.com/gcdm/oauth/token \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded' \
  --data client_id=cj5b3499-4918-40x6-a232-f4112f837d72 \
  --data device_code=yourDeviceCode \            
  --data grant_type=urn:ietf:params:oauth:grant-type:device_code \
  --data code_verifier=yourCodeVerifier

Response details:

access_token: your token to access the CarData APIs
token_type: the type of the token (Bearer)
expires_in: the duration in seconds until the access token expires
refresh_token: the token to refresh your access token
scope: the given scope(s) of your token(s)
id_token: your token to access the CarData data stream
gcid: your unique identifier of your portal user account
The response contains three tokens, consisting of an access token, the refresh token and the ID token.


The access token:

Use this token to access the CarData APIs, by including it in the header of each request to authenticate as the requesting user. In the back end, we verify the user, check the associated scope and ensure that the given token is still valid and has not yet expired. The access token is valid for 1 hour (3600 seconds).


The refresh token:

Use this token to refresh your access-token and your ID-token. The refresh-token is valid for two weeks (1.209.600 seconds). Once your refresh-token has expired, you have to rerun the device code flow and register your device again. Therefore, it is suggested to refresh your refresh-token in time. When a client ID is de-subscribed from its associated services, the corresponding refresh-token would lose its validity immediately.


The ID token:

The ID token is used to access the CarData data stream. For further details, please refer to the associated chapters of this document. The ID token is valid for one hour (3600 seconds).


2.4 Step 4: Refresh your tokens iteratively
In order to access vehicle data - either per stream or REST API calls - you have to remain authenticated with a valid token. If your current access token/ID token is about to expire, you can easily request a new one using the refresh token as an input parameter in the token endpoint:

/gcdm/oauth/token

Example curl for requesting a new access token with the refresh token:

curl --request POST \
  --url https://customer.bmwgroup.com/gcdm/oauth/token \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded' \
  --data grant_type=refresh_token \
  --data refresh_token=yourRefreshToken \
  --data client_id=cj5b3499-4918-40x6-a232-f4112f837d72

This generates a new set of access token, refresh token and ID token and also resets the expiry timer of each token. Please refer to the Swagger or this chapter for further explanation concerning the response.



3. CarData API
This chapter contains additional information about the CarData RESTful API. For further details, please refer to the swagger documentation.


3.1 Prerequisites
You must perform the following steps to be able to access the CarData endpoints:

Mapping of the vehicle

The vehicle you want to retrieve data for needs to be mapped to your customer portal account. You need to be PRIMARY user (i.e. main user / admin) for the given VIN.

Generated client ID

You have successfully generated a client ID in your customer portal.

Subscription & scope

You are successfully subscribed to the CarData API & your device was registered with the correct scope. This chapter contains more information about this step. Be aware, the subscription must have been performed before registering your device.

CarData
Figure 6: Subscribe to API

Device code flow & access token

In order to use our CarData API solution, you need to authenticate via a valid access token which needs to be included in every call. The retrieval of the access token is part of our Device Code Flow. Use the corresponding chapters from this integration guide and the device-code-flow swagger.


3.2 Authentication
The access token needs to be included in the header of each CarData API request. Further details on how to retrieve this token are described here.


3.3 Additional information concerning the CarData endpoints
Additional information about CarData endpoints, their input parameters and the structure of their responses can be found in the CarData API Swagger.

In addition to the technical documentation, the upcoming chapters contain supplementary information. Most of the endpoints can be used to retrieve data which were generated by using the given vehicle. Therefor it is suggested to take a deeper look into the telematics data catalogue, as this documentation contains the description and additional metadata for each telematic key.

Consider rate-limit:

The use of the CarData APIs is subject to a daily rate limit of 50 requests. If you require more frequent access to your vehicle data, we recommend utilizing the CarData streaming solution.


3.3.1 Endpoint: Mapping information
GET /customers/vehicles/mappings

The mapping endpoint returns information about vehicles that are mapped to your account, including the mapping type (PRIMARY or SECONDARY). Be aware that you are only able to retrieve data for mapped vehicles for which you are the primary user.

Consider:

Not all vehicle models are capable of having secondary users. If there is no such concept, the mapped user is considered the primary user.

Home Assistant users can trigger the `cardata.fetch_vehicle_mappings` developer tool service to call this endpoint and inspect the mapping payload in the logs.

To retrieve static vehicle metadata (brand, model, etc.), use `cardata.fetch_basic_data`, which calls `GET /customers/vehicles/{vin}/basicData` and logs the response.


3.3.2 Endpoints: Container management
CarData offers you four endpoints to manage your containers. The endpoints have the following path:
/customers/containers/

Use the telematics data catalogue for further details about the available telematics data keys. Be aware that there is a limit of 10 containers per user.

Create your container(s) via the POST endpoint. Use the telematics data catalogue for the correct syntax concerning the technicalDescriptor for a telematic data key.

Consider:

You are able to add all available keys from the TDC to a container, though keys which are bound to a dedicated endpoint - see this table - can not be retrieved via the data-retrieval-endpoint.
Via the GET-endpoints you can retrieve all information about your created containers. A container can either have the state ACTIVE or INACTIVE. The data retrieval for a given container is only achievable for containers with the state ACTIVE.
Via the DELETE-endpoint you can set state for a container to INACTIVE. Containers which have the state INACTIVE will be deleted after 29 days automatically.


3.3.3 Retrieve your vehicle data for a container
With the following endpoint you are able to retrieve available data for telematics keys which were defined in the given container:

GET /customers/vehicles/{vin}/telematicData

Telematics keys which belong to the category BASIC DATA or which are bound to a dedicated endpoint will not be shown in this data retrieval. These cases are furthermore described in the upcoming chapter.

Example response:

{
"name: "vehicle.cabin.infotainment.navigation.currentLocation.longitude",
"timestamp": ""2025-07-28T05:16:53.000Z",
"unit": “degrees”,
"value": "9.498705"
}

You can find more information about the timestamp here.


3.3.4 Retrieve your vehicle data for predefined use cases
The following table provides an overview of dedicated endpoints for specific telematics keys.
